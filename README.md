# Setup
Make sure you have cargo installed. If not, follow the [cargo installation instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).
Clone this repository. Make sure you are inside the folder with the `README.md` for these last parts.
Create a file `discord.txt` and inside it, paste in your discord bot token. Make sure there are no extra spaces or text - It must be exact.
Run `cargo run`. Cargo may a long time to download dependencies but once that's done, the bot will start and you will see `<your bot name> is connected`.
